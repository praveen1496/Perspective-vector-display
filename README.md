# Perspective-vector-display
Computer Graphics

## Implement a system to read in a geometric data of a polygonal object and to display using perspective transformation. 
This includes clipping routine (assuming that object will always be in the viewing volume).

### Input:
a) Geometric data for polygonal object (Some example files are in https://icg.gwu.edu/models-and-related-stuff)
b) Viewing specification

## Output:
Perspective view of the object displayed on the viewport with the brick faces removed.
